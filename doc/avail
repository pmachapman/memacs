Thank you for your inquiry,

MicroEMACS is available from a number of different sources. Via FTP on
Internet, it can be obtained from midas.mgmt.purdue.edu (128.210.13.1)
via anonymous FTP. That version is always the latest full release (in
this case version 3.12) in compressed TAR format.

Also you can call my BBS system, The Programmer's Room, at (317)
742-5533 to receive the very latest interim release (version 3.12 at
this time). This version is not always guarenteed to be completely bug
free, but it will always be the latest. The latest full release is also
available from this BBS.

Lastly, the below listed releases are available by sending a check for
$25 for each product you which to recieve and specify the disk format
